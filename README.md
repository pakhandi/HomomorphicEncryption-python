HomomorphicEncryption-python
============================

It kind of encryption mechanism mostly used in cloud which allows specific types of computations to be carried out on ciphertext and obtain an encrypted result which decrypted matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.


Introduction
============================

In Homomorphic Encryption we try to implement basic concept to encrypt the data before sending them to the Cloud provider. But, this one will have to decrypt them each time he has to work on them. The client will need to provide the private key to the server to decrypt the data before execute the calculations required, which might affect the confidentiality of data stored in the Cloud.The Homomorphic Encryption method is able to perform operations of encrypted data without decrypting them.

Implementation
============================

Here we try to implement simple homomorphic encryption in python


>>To run python homo.py
Enter the desired integer input to see the result with the output of crypted and decrypted text
